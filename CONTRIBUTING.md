Contributing
============
Thank you for considering contributing to the Repokid project!  Get started by reading `development setup` then look for something in our [open issues](https://github.com/Netflix/repokid/issues) that matches your interest and skillset (or file an issue for something if it doesn't exist yet).  Please make sure to follow the guidelines outlined in `submitting changes` and consider joining our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/netflix-repokid/Lobby).  Happy hacking!

Development Setup
-----------------
Please follow the instructions in Repokid's [getting started](https://github.com/Netflix/repokid/#getting-started) section.  If you encounter any problems with the instructions please file an issue.

Issue Tags
----------
First time contributors should consider tackling an issue marked with `difficulty:newcomer` first.  These issues are relatively easy and a good way to get started.  

We also have some issues tagged with `help wanted`.  These issues are something we'd love help with and are a great way to get significantly involved with the project.


Submitting Changes
------------------
If you're adding something to one of our modules that are already covered by unit tests please add tests that exercise your change.  We're working on adding unit tests for other modules and looking for help to get to 100% coverage.

Please also verify that the changes you've made work as expected locally.
